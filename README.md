Hi, My name is Muskanpreet and I’m thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project focused on analyzing pizza sales data using MySQL. 

This project allowed me to dive deep into the intricacies of data management and analysis, offering valuable insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and operational efficiency.

The Pizza Sales Data Analysis project aims to leverage MySQL to analyze data related to pizza sales. I have utilized SQL queries to extract insights, and solving various questions related to pizza sales to help understand sales trends.

I’m eager to continue leveraging data to drive meaningful business outcomes.

Thank you for your time and interest in this project.

Best regards,

Muskanpreet
